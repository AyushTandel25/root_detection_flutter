# Root Detection and Security for Flutter App

## Overview

This Flutter application incorporates advanced root detection mechanisms to enhance mobile app security. It includes functionality to detect rooted or jailbroken devices and provides additional protection against sophisticated tools like **Frida** that can bypass traditional root detection methods.

## Features

- **Root Detection**: Identifies whether the device is rooted (Android) or jailbroken (iOS).
- **Frida Detection**: Detects the presence of Frida, a tool that can manipulate and analyze app behavior.
- **Security Measures**: Restricts access to critical functionalities if root or Frida is detected to prevent unauthorized modifications.

## Background

Rooting (Android) or jailbreaking (iOS) can compromise device and app security. While standard root detection mechanisms are essential, they can be bypassed using tools like Frida. Frida allows dynamic instrumentation, making it possible to alter and observe app behavior in real-time, even if root detection is implemented.

## How It Works

1. **Root Detection**:
    - The app checks for common indicators of root or jailbreak status.
    - If detected, it flags the device and applies necessary restrictions.

2. **Frida Detection**:
    - The app performs checks to identify the presence of Frida or similar tools.
    - If Frida is detected, the app restricts access to sensitive functionalities to mitigate potential risks.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repository.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd your-repository
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    flutter pub get
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the app on your device or emulator:
    ```bash
    flutter run
    ```

2. The app will automatically check for root/jailbreak status and the presence of Frida, applying security measures as necessary.
